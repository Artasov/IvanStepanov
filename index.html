                <p>
                    When I joined the company, the process of transitioning from a monolith on ruby to a platform of
                    services on node.js was underway. A seamless transition was required, given that two mobile apps
                    were tied to the monolith.<br>

                    Management expected the work was almost done. However, after diving into the project, it became
                    clear that a new approach to application integration with the platform needed to be designed. During
                    my time at the company:

                        <p>Designed an ACL (anti-corruption layer) for a soft launch of the new platform. Drafted a work

                            communicated them to the team. Completed the development of the MVP version by the time I
                            left

                            statuses to
                            identify bottlenecks. One such bottleneck was testing, as there was only one tester.
                            Therefore,
                            I partially shifted testing responsibilities onto the backend developers.</p>

                <h5>System Analyst | Architect | Head of architecture / skyeng.ru</h5>
                <strong class="text-black-a0">Mar 2018 - Dec 2022</strong>
                <p>In the company, I transitioned from being a system analyst on the IT projects to the head of IT
                    architecture department. During this time:</p>
                <h6 class="text-secondary mt-3">CRM System Transition</h6>
                <p>I undertook a project to transition from an inhouse CRM system based on a state machine, which served
                    as the business core and data source for all other systems, to a process-oriented CRM system
                    consisting of domain components and services. As an analyst, I led a small team of 3 analysts, wrote
                    user stories, depicted ERD, gathered requirements from the client, and filtered incoming requests
                    for new feature to meet the deadlines. I resolved all stages from requirement collection to system
                    deployment.<br>

                    One and a half years of work resulted in more than 200 user stories. With team was developed 5 major
                    modules: sales, support, teacher search, awake service, and core of system. We provided executable
                    BPMS diagrams in Camunda and successfully launched the system.</p>
                <h6 class="text-secondary mt-3">Transition to Architecture Team</h6>
                <p>After the CRM project was implemented, I joined the architecture team. I designed business solutions
                    at the IT and business levels of architecture, and validated the economic and business values of
                    projects. Over a year, I worked on three major projects where I described the business challenges,
                    potential business and technical solutions and estimate implementation costs. Upon the project
                    defenses, I successfully argued for the need to abandon the realization because none of the projects
                    passed an economic justification. One project was simplified to a simple managerial procedure
                    instead of an expensive IT solution.<br>

                    Company has savings of around ~1m$ by not initiating these projects.</p>
                <h6 class="text-secondary mt-3">As Head of Architecture</h6>
                <p>In a role as the head of architecture, I established a repository for ADR and created a universal
                    dashboard displaying Coupling/Cohesion metrics. Based on this, architects identified problematic
                    services. I designed another dashboard using Maurice H. Halstead metrics that show which services
                    need an attention in first priority. I made a IT landscape map with key parameters of services which
                    help to understand the borders of responsibility of the services and they purpose. Suggested a
                    architecture of IT landscape where business and IT services had shared boundaries, aiming to form as
                    many autonomous teams as possible. All of these solutions initiated a consensus process among teams,
                    uncovering many projects with ambiguous agreements. During my tenure, there were about 20
                    development teams in the company, facing challenges because teams frequently blocked each other.
                    Sadly, the enterprise architecture transformation project's deployment was halted due to a crisis in
